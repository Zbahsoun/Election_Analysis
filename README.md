# Colorado's Election Analysis


## Overview of the Project

We will be assisting Tom with the Colorado election audit, using Python programming language to audit the election's data. Our job is to report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes and percentage for each candidate, the number of votes and percentage for each county, the largest county turnout, the winning candidate, the vote count and its percentage. 

## Election Audit Results

### Let's look deeper into our script and data results presented in the image below.

### Using loops and conditional statements we were able to report the following:

- There are 369,711 votes in total, divided on candidates as follow:

    - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
    - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
    - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

## Election Audit Summary

The script created to audit this election's data is simple yet very efficient, we can also apply it to other elections data sets and just by changing the path of the file to load, we can calculate and display the same type of results. This script can also be used to manage a larger number of data, more diverse type of data, just by adding variables, loops and if statements. For example
